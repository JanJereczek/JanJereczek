Hi, I’m Jan, a PhD student at the Complutense University of Madrid. Besides preparing the revolution in my basement, I am part of CriticalEarth, an Innovative Training Network of our beloved European comission (it sounds ironic, but I mean it, it pays every expense of my luxurious life). How innovative are we? I don't know but I am enjoying myself - which is at least equally important.

I’m interested in climate physics and modelling with a focus on the cryosphere and its interactions with the solid Earth. Because I like to confuse myself, I include dynamical systems theory, control theory and machine learning in my work. I spend most of my working time programming softwares related to this.

With the help of my supervisors and collaborators, I am developping following packages:
- [FastIsostasy.jl](https://github.com/JanJereczek/FastIsostasy.jl), which allows you to compute kiloyears of high-resolution glacial isostatic adjustment within seconds. Even on Earth structures that are laterally variable!
- [Regional models for glacial isostatic adjustment]([https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/TransitionsInTimeseries.jl](https://github.com/palma-ice/isostasy)), which is a fortran version of FastIsostasy.jl that also includes all regional GIA models commonly used in ice-sheet modelling.
- [TransitionsInTimeseries](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/TransitionsInTimeseries.jl), which allows you to forecast/diagnose transitions in a dynamical system (of dimension and co-dimension 1 of course, we don't want to get too crazy).
