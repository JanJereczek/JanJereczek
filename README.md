Hi, I’m Jan, (yet another) PhD student (that make >1h lunch breaks with colleagues) at the Complutense University of Madrid. Besides preparing the revolution in my basement, I am part of the CriticalEarth, an "Innovative Training Network" of our beloved European comission (it sounds ironic, but I mean it, it pays every expense of my luxurious life). How innovative are we? I don't know but I am enjoying myself - which is at least equally important.

I’m interested in climate physics and modelling with a focus on the cryosphere and its interactions with the solid Earth. Because I like to confuse myself, I include dynamical systems theory, control theory and machine learning in my work. Sometimes I even program something related to this.

With the help of my supervisors and collaborators, I am developping following julia packages:
- [FastIsostasy.jl](https://github.com/JanJereczek/FastIsostasy.jl), which allows you to compute kiloyears of high-resolution glacial isostatic adjustment within seconds. Even on Earth structures that are laterally variable!
- [TransitionsInTimeseries](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/TransitionsInTimeseries.jl), which allows you to forecast/diagnose transitions in a dynamical system (of dimension and co-dimension 1 of course, we don't want to get too crazy). 

How to reach me: janswier@ucm.es, but it's even nicer if you come around for a tea at my office.
