Hi, I’m Jan, a PhD student at the Complutense University of Madrid. Besides preparing the revolution in my basement, I study the stability of the Antarctic Ice Sheet within [ClimTip](https://www.climate-tipping-points.eu/), a European initiative that investigates tipping elements of the Earth system.

I’m interested in climate physics and modelling, with a focus on the cryosphere and its interactions with the solid Earth. Because I like to confuse myself, I include dynamical systems, control theory and machine learning in my work. I spend most of my working time programming softwares related to this.

With the help of my supervisors and collaborators, I am developping following packages:
- [FastIsostasy.jl](https://github.com/JanJereczek/FastIsostasy.jl), which allows you to compute kiloyears of high-resolution glacial isostatic adjustment within seconds - even on Earth structures that are laterally variable! This also includes optimized implementations of other regional GIA models that are commonly used in ice-sheet modelling.
- [FastIsostasy.f90](https://github.com/palma-ice/isostasy), which is a fortran version of FastIsostasy.jl.
- [Pagos.jl](https://github.com/fesmc/Pagos.jl), an ice-sheet model that is still in the initial phase of its development.
- [TransitionsInTimeseries](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/TransitionsInTimeseries.jl), which allows you to forecast/diagnose transitions in a dynamical system (of dimension and co-dimension 1 of course, we don't want to get too crazy).

I am also participating in [GRDMIP](https://github.com/hollyhan/GRDMIP), a the gravity, rotation and deformation model intercomparison project.
